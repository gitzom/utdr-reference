Spells are casted either during battle or in the Power menu (This goes nearly completly unusued however because TP gets turned into extra dark dollars after pretty much every battle.) 

> [!NOTE]
> While the word "spells" may imply that this code is only used for spells you can cast this also applies to items in scr_spell. Pretty much everywhere else though this doesn't apply.

## Spell Structure

In DELTARUNE spells contain:
- An ID
    - This is used in the switch case statement inside of `scr_spell` to decide what code to run and is checked in `scr_spelltext` to decide which code to display. When it comes to items it appears that their IDs are offset by 200.
- Spell Name
    - Known as `spellname`, this is the name that will show up in the Power Menu
- Battle Alias
    - Known as `spellnameb`, this is the name that will show up during battle
- Spell Description
    - Known as `spelldesc`, this is the name that will show up in the Power Menu
- Battle Description
    - Known as `spelldescb`, this is the name that will show up during battle
- Spell Target
    - Known as `spelltarget`, this is the target of the spell
        - 0 doesn't give a decision
        - 1 selects an ally
        - 2 selects an opponent
- TP Cost
    - Known as `cost`, this is the amount of TP it costs to use that spell. Please note that the TP cost will be 2/5 of what you put here. 80 cost = 32% TP
- Overworld Usability
    - Known as `spellusable`, this determines wether or not the spell is usable in the overworld.
- Spell Usability
    - Known as `usable`, this variable's use is currently unknown, it is most likely a remnant of `scr_iteminfo`.

        healnum = global.battlemag[arg1] * 999;
        scr_heal(star, healnum);
        global.charinstance[star].healnum = healnum;
        global.spelldelay = 15;
        break;
```

### scr_spell_overworld
