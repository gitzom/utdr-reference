## global.cinstance[]
global.cinstance, standing for Character Instance, is an array containing the idThe following is the usage for global.cinstance in DELTARUNE
 The index is basically WHICH like in the list of the objects which index it is in that list and then the

 you can do .name and .x and .y to the things returned by cinstance[n]

 in terms of the value of cinstance[n] itself i think its 0 for kris, 1 for susie and i assume 2 for ralsei and 3 for noelle? IDK though


 It seems that each cinstance[0], [1], and [2] contain objects that represent the people following yo[u right now. For example, in much of chapter 1, the object representing Ralsei is in cinstance[0].
