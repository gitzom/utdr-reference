## global.cinstance[]
global.cinstance, standing for Character Instance, is an array containing the ids of the characters currently following the player in the overworld. It has a length of 3. The objects that the ids point to are instances of [obj_caterpillarchara](actors_and_caterpillars).

The order of which characters are at which indices changes based on the order in which they are following you. For example, in much of Chapter 1, the object representing Ralsei is in cinstance[0], since he is your only follower.
