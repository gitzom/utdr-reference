# Text & Dialogue

## Localization
### Lang Files

All of DELTARUNE Chapter 1's dialogue is stored in the Chapter 1 `lang` folder, which is located in the same directory as where the [Chapter 1 WAD file resides](../../Tools/GameMaker/WADFiles.md#deltarune). The English and Japanese translations are named `lang_en.json` and `lang_ja.json` respectively. 

The beginning of Chapter 1's `lang_en.json` is shown below:

```json
{
  "date": "1540902565549",
  "DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_5_0": " ^9 ^8 %",
  "DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_6_0": " ARE YOU^6& THERE^6?\\M1 ^6 %",
  "DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_7_0": "^6 \\M0ARE WE^6&CONNECTED^6?\\M1 ^6 ^6 %%",
  ...
}
``` 

Each JSON file contains a `date` key whose value is a timestamp encoded in unix time. Each subsequent key is a dialogue ID (e.g. `DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_5_0`) with the appropriate translation as the corresponding value. The dialogue IDs are the same between the English and Japanese JSONs, making it easy for the game to find the correct text translation just from the text's dialogue ID.

Starting from Chapter 2, DELTARUNE's English dialogue no longer exists in a `lang_en.json` file but is instead embedded in the code of the WAD file. However, Japanese dialogue still remains in a `lang_ja.json` file.  

### 8-4 Localization Scripts

The `scr_84` scripts, likely named after DELTARUNE's localization company "8-4", handle DELTARUNE's localization system. When DELTARUNE's initializer object, `obj_initializer2`, is created, it calls the localization initialization script, `scr_84_init_localization`, in its Create event.

In essence, this script initializes some important global variables:

Variable Name | Type | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`global.lang` | `string` | <ul><li>Can either be `en` or `ja`.</li><li>First tries to read the value from the `LANG` key in the `LANG` header of `true_config.ini`</li><li>Otherwise, the variable is set via the builtin GameMaker function `os_get_language`.</li><li>Determines whether the other global variables, besides `global.lang_map` post-Chapter 1, load the English or Japanese translation.</li></ul>
`global.lang_map` | `DS Map` | <ul><li>A DS map containing all of DELTARUNE's Japanese dialogue.</li><li>`scr_84_init_localization` calls `scr_84_lang_load`, which, if the language is set to Japanese, loads this variable by reading the `lang_ja.json` file through the wrapper script `scr_84_load_map_json`.</li><li>In Chapter 1, this variable may also hold the contents of `lang_en.json` if the language is set to English.</li></ul>
`global.font_map` | `DS Map` | <ul><li>A DS map that contains either English or Japanese fonts based on the current language.</li><li>The font IDs are the font names without the `fnt_` or `fnt_ja_` prefix.</li><li>Example: Font ID `main` is mapped to `fnt_main` in English and to `fnt_ja_main` in Japanese.</li></ul>
`global.chemg_sprite_map`<br>`global.chemg_sound_map`| `DS Map` | <ul><li>DS maps that contain either English or Japanese assets based on the current language.</li><li>The asset IDs are the English asset names.</li><li>Example: In `global.chemg_sound_map`, sound ID `snd_flowery_voiceclip_glue` is mapped to `snd_flowery_voiceclip_glue` in English and `snd_flowery_voiceclip_glue_ja` in Japanese.</li></ul>

The following wrapper scripts are used throughout the game's code to access these global variables:

Script Name | Notes
--- | ---
`scr_84_get_font`| <ul><li>Takes a font ID and returns the corresponding font found in `global.font_map`</li><li>Example: `f = scr_84_get_font("mainbig");`</li></ul>
`scr_84_set_draw_font` | <ul><li>Takes a font ID and sets the current draw font to the corresponding font in `global.font_map`</li><li>Example: `scr_84_set_draw_font("dotumche");`</li></ul>
`scr_84_get_lang_string` | <ul><li>Takes a dialogue ID and returns the corresponding dialogue string in `global.lang_map`</li><li>Example: `s = scr_84_get_lang_string("scr_text_slash_scr_text_gml_2198_0");`</li></ul>
`scr_84_get_sprite` | <ul><li>Takes a sprite ID and returns the corresponding sprite found in `global.chemg_sprite_map`</li><li>Example: `menu_sprite = scr_84_get_sprite("spr_darkmenudesc");`</li></ul>
`scr_84_get_sound` | <ul><li>Takes a sound ID and returns the corresponding sound found in `global.chemg_sound_map`</li><li>Example: `snd_stop(scr_84_get_sound("snd_ja_kidding"));`</li><ul>

There are also some 8-4 scripts that do not access the global localization variables:

Script Name | Notes
--- | ---
`scr_84_get_subst_string` | <ul><li>Is only used in Chapters 1 and 3; functions similarly to `substringargs`.</li><li>Takes an input string and multiple replacement strings; All instances of `~n`in the input string are replaced by the `n`th replacement string, where `n` is a positive integer.</li><li>Example: `s = scr_84_get_subst_string("* ~1 spared!/%", enemyname);` replaces `~1` with `enemyname` and sets `s` to the resultant string.</li></ul>
`scr_84_name_input_setup` | <ul><li>Sets up the character system used to name both the Vessel and the Player</li><li>Called in `DEVICE_CHOICE`'s `User Event 0` script for initialization, and then again in `DEVICE CHOICE`'s `Step` event if the character system has been changed.</li><li>Based on the value of `LANGSUBTYPE`, sets up (0) English, (1) Hiragana, (2) Katakana, or (3) English. A `LANGSUBTYPE` value of 0 is only used for English, while 1-3 are used for Japanese, with extra selectable options added at the bottom of the layout to swap between the different character systems. The addition of these options in 3 is why 0 and 3 are different.</li></ul> 
`scr_84_draw_text_outline` | <ul><li>A modified version of `draw_text` that creates outlined text by drawing the text in black in all cardinal directions before drawing the main text in the center</li><li>Doesn't draw the blackened text in all 8 directions and doesn't take an additional `color` argument used for the center text, unlike `draw_text_outline`</li><li>Example: `scr_84_draw_text_outline(myx, myy, "[Left / Right]")` draws an outlined version of `[Left / Right]` at `(myx, myy)`.</li></ul>
`scr_84_load_ini` | <ul><li>Initializes the name, room, level, and time information for each file in the file select screen; called in `DEVICE_MENU`.</li><li>Called right after `scr_change_language` (see below for more information)</li></ul>

The script used to change languages in the file select screen is `scr_change_language`. This script swaps `global.lang` from `en` to `ja` or from `ja` to `en` and then saves `global.lang` in `true_config.ini`, under the header `LANG` and the key `LANG`.


> [!NOTE] DELTARUNE Demo Chapter 1 Scripts
> The DELTARUNE demo contains `_ch1` versions of the 8-4 scripts to differentiate them from Chapter 2's scripts. Most of these scripts function exactly the same as the non-`_ch1` versions, but some have small changes to be compatible with Chapter 1's code. For example, `scr_84_lang_load_ch1` reads `lang_en.json` if the current language is English, which is not a feature in `scr_84_lang_load` as English dialogue is embedded in the WAD file post-Chapter 1 instead of being in an external file.

> **Unused 8-4 Scripts:**
>
> - `scr_84_add_menu_item`
> - `scr_84_draw_menu`
> - `scr_84_pop`
> - `scr_84_push`
> - `scr_84_is_digit`

There also exists a debug script, `scr_84_debug`, that is used in `obj_time` and takes a boolean argument. However, the script is empty. It is likely that the script's contents were removed for the release version of DELTARUNE.

## Control Characters

Symbol | Description
--- | ---
`^[1-9]` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to wait a certain amount of frames before continuing to write dialogue. <br> It is most commonly used right before commas and ellipses. <br> Each number corresponds to a different amount of frames. Deltarune runs at 30 frames per second. <br> `1`: 5 frames. <br>`2`: 10 frames. <br> `3`: 15 frames. <br> `4`: 20 frames. <br> `5`: 30 frames. <br> `6`: 40 frames. <br> `7`: 60 frames. <br> `8`: 90 frames. <br> `9`: 150 frames.
`/` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to stop writing dialogue for the current message. This doesn’t end the conversation, as pressing [CONFIRM] advances the text to the next message.
`/%` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to stop writing dialogue for the current message. After pressing [CONFIRM], the dialogue box goes away.
`%%` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to immediately close the dialogue box after it is reached.
`\` | When using a control character with a backslash (\) in it, you must escape the backslash with another backslash. For example, `\\E1` is a valid control character that tells Deltarune to change the current character’s emotion to index 1.
`\E[alphanumeric]` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to change the current face’s emotion. <br> <br> The number or letter after “E” tells Deltarune what emotion index to use. <br> `0-9` uses index 0-9. <br> `A-Z` uses indexes 10-35. <br> `a-z` uses indexes 36-60.
`\F` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to change the current face. <br> The number or letter after “F” tells Deltarune what face to use. <br> `0`: No face. <br> `S`: Susie. <br> `R`: Ralsei. <br> `N`: Noelle. <br> `T`: Toriel <br> `L`: Lancer. <br> `A`: Asgore <br> `a`: Alphys <br> `B`: Berdly <br> `r`: Rudy <br> `u`: Rouxls Kaard <br> `K`: King
`\T(number)` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to change the typer, which controls how text is displayed and heard. <br> The number or letter after “T” tells Deltarune what typer to use. <br>`0`: Default <br>`1`: Silent in the Light World <br>`A`: Asgore <br>`a`: Alphys <br>`N`: Noelle <br>`n`: Noelle but with small text <br>`B`: Berdly <br>`S`: Susie <br>`R`: Ralsei <br>`L`: Lancer <br>`X`: Silent in the Dark World <br>`r`: Rudy <br>`T`: Toriel <br>`J`: Jevil <br>`K`: King
`\f[0-9]` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to add a small face and text to the screen. 
`\*` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to type a keyboard button or draw a controller button sprite. <br> This is only used when a controller is connected by calling scr_get_input_name(), where the first variable is a number from 0-9. <br>`0`: Move down <br>`1`: Move right <br>`2`: Move up <br>`3`: Move left <br>`4`: Confirm 1 (Defaults to Z) <br>`5`: Cancel 1 (Defaults to X) <br>`6`: Menu 1 (Defaults to C) <br>`7`: Confirm 2 (Defaults to Enter) <br>`8`: Cancel 2 (Defaults to Shift) <br>`9`: Menu 2 (Defaults to Control)
`\s` | This a control character that tells Deltarune whether the text is skippable or not. <br>`0`: False <br>`1`: True
`\c` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to color the following text a different color. <br> The letter or number after “c” controls what color to use.<br>`R`: Red <br>`B`: Blue <br>`Y`: Yellow <br>`G`: Lime <br>`W`: White <br>`X`: Black <br>`0`: Reset
`\C` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to bring up a choicer. <br><br> The number after “C” tells Deltarune whether to use the old choicer, and how many choices there should be. <br>`1`: Old Choicer (How Undertale’s choicer looks) <br>`2`: New Choicer, 2 Choices <br>`3`: New Choicer: 3 Choices <br>`4`: New Choicer: 4 Choices
`\M` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to change an overworld sprite using global.flag[20]. <br> The number after “M” tells Deltarune what to set the flag to.
`\S` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to play a sound while text is writing. <br> The number after “S” tells Deltarune which predefined sound to play using global.writersnd[0-9].
`\I` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to insert an image while text is writing. <br> The number after “I” tells Deltarune which predefined image to draw using global.writerimg[0-9].
`#` | This is essentially a replacement for the `\n` character, it is a new line character
