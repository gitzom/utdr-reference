# Text & Dialogue

## Lang Files

All of DELTARUNE Chapter 1's dialogue is stored in the Chapter 1 `lang` folder, which is located in the same directory as where the [Chapter 1 WAD file resides](../../Tools/GameMaker/WADFiles.md#deltarune). The English and Japanese translations are named `lang_en.json` and `lang_ja.json` respectively. 

The beginning of Chapter 1's `lang_en.json` is shown below:

```js
{
  "date": "1540902565549",
  "DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_5_0": " ^9 ^8 %",
  "DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_6_0": " ARE YOU^6& THERE^6?\\M1 ^6 %",
  "DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_7_0": "^6 \\M0ARE WE^6&CONNECTED^6?\\M1 ^6 ^6 %%",
  ...
}
``` 

Each JSON file contains a `date` key whose value is a timestamp encoded in unix time. Each subsequent key is a dialogue ID (e.g. `DEVICE_CONTACT_slash_Step_0_gml_5_0`) with the appropriate translation as the corresponding value. The dialogue IDs are the same between the English and Japanese JSONs, making it easy for the game to find the correct text translation just from the text's dialogue ID.

Starting from Chapter 2, DELTARUNE's English dialogue no longer exists in a `lang_en.json` file but is instead embedded in the code of the WAD file. However, Japanese dialogue still remains in a `lang_ja.json` file.  

## Control Characters

Symbol | Description
--- | ---
`^[1-9]` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to wait a certain amount of frames before continuing to write dialogue. <br> It is most commonly used right before commas and ellipses. <br> Each number corresponds to a different amount of frames. Deltarune runs at 30 frames per second. <br> `1`: 5 frames. <br>`2`: 10 frames. <br> `3`: 15 frames. <br> `4`: 20 frames. <br> `5`: 30 frames. <br> `6`: 40 frames. <br> `7`: 60 frames. <br> `8`: 90 frames. <br> `9`: 150 frames.
`/` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to stop writing dialogue for the current message. This doesn’t end the conversation, as pressing [CONFIRM] advances the text to the next message.
`/%` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to stop writing dialogue for the current message. After pressing [CONFIRM], the dialogue box goes away.
`%%` | This is a control character that tells Deltarune to immediately close the dialogue box after it is reached.
`\` | When using a control character with a backslash (\) in it, you must escape the backslash with another backslash. For example, `\\E1` is a valid control character that tells Deltarune to change the current character’s emotion to index 1.
`\E[alphanumeric]` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to change the current face’s emotion. <br> <br> The number or letter after “E” tells Deltarune what emotion index to use. <br> `0-9` uses index 0-9. <br> `A-Z` uses indexes 10-35. <br> `a-z` uses indexes 36-60.
`\F` | This a control character that tells Deltarune to change the current face. <br> The number or letter after “F” tells Deltarune what face to use. <br> `0`: No face. <br> `S`: Susie. <br> `R`: Ralsei. <br> `N`: Noelle. <br> `T`: Toriel <br> `L`: Lancer. <br> `A`: Asgore <br> `a`: Alphys <br> `B`: Berdly <br> `r`: Rudy <br> `u`: Rouxls Kaard <br> `K`: King
