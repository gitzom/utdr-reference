# WAD Files

When a GameMaker game is compiled and distributed, all of the game's logic and most of its assets are stored in a WAD ("Where's All the Data?") file. The default name for the WAD file will change based on what operating system the game was compiled for.

Operating System | WAD File Name
--- | ---
Windows | `data.win`
Linux | `game.unx`
macOS / iOS | `game.ios`
Android | `game.droid`

Note that the WAD file is not the `.exe` file, which also usually exists in the same directory where the WAD file is.

The default location of the WAD file depends on which operating system the game was downloaded on. 

## UNDERTALE

The following are the default WAD file paths for UNDERTALE if it was installed through Steam:

Operating System | Default UNDERTALE WAD File Path
--- | ---
Windows | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Undertale\data.win`
Linux | `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale/assets/game.unx`
macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale/UNDERTALE.app/Contents/Resources/game.ios`

## DELTARUNE Demo

The WAD files for the DELTARUNE demo can be found in the following places if installed through Steam:

Operating System | Default DELTARUNE Demo WAD File Path
--- | ---
Windows | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DELTARUNEdemo\data.win`
macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/DELTARUNEdemo/DELTARUNE.app/Contents/Resources/game.ios`

## DELTARUNE

Instead of having all of DELTARUNE's logic in one WAD file, the purchasable release of DELTARUNE contains a Chapter Select WAD file (found in the "root" directory) and then individual WAD files for each chapter. The default DELTARUNE root directory is as follows:

Operating System | Default DELTARUNE Root Directory
--- | ---
Windows | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DELTARUNE\`
macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/DELTARUNE/DELTARUNE.app/Contents/Resources/`

The root directory also contains folders for each chapter, with each folder containing the respective WAD file for that chapter. The folders are named as follows, with `X` representing the chapter number:

Operating System | Default DELTARUNE Chapter Folder Name
--- | ---
Windows | `chapterX_windows`
macOS | `chapterX_mac`

For example, a Windows installation with the first five chapters installed might look like the following (with irrelevant files and folders discarded):

```text
.
.
└── DELTARUNE/
    ├── chapter1_windows/
    │   └── data.win
    ├── chapter2_windows/
    │   └── data.win
    ├── chapter3_windows/
    │   └── data.win
    ├── chapter4_windows/
    │   └── data.win
    ├── chapter5_windows/
    │   └── data.win
    ├── data.win
    └── DELTARUNE.exe
```
